Project Goal:
Design and implement an open-source Python-based AI/ML system that converts input text into natural-sounding speech using customizable voice models.

Description:
The project will focus on building a Text-to-Speech (TTS) pipeline where the generated voice can be selected from multiple speakers (e.g., myself, friends, or family members). For each speaker, a custom voice model will be created and trained using their voice samples.

The system will allow users to:

Train or fine-tune voice models from recorded audio data

Select a specific speaker’s voice model

Convert any input text into speech using the selected voice

Technical Requirements:

Implemented entirely in Python

Uses only open-source tools, frameworks, and models

Supports multi-speaker voice modeling

Modular pipeline for data preprocessing, training, inference, and audio output

Outcome:
A fully open-source, customizable text-to-speech system capable of generating speech in multiple personalized voices.
